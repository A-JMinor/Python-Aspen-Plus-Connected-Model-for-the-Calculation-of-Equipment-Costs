# Prerequisites and Covered Types of Heat Exchangers

**This code only works correctly if the units in Aspen Plus for temperature and power / enthalpy flow are set to K and kW, respectively.**

This code is written for 4 types of heat exchangers: 1) double pipe for areas below 14 m<sup>2</sup>, 2) shell and tube for areas above m<sup>2</sup>, 3) fired heaters for temperatures above 252째C but below 300째C, and 4) specialised fired heaters (using Dowtherm A) for temperatures above 300째C.

For the first two types of heat exchangers, that work at temperatures until 252째C, a *HeatX* model needs to be chosen in Aspen Plus. The most commonly used *Heater* model will not work, as it does not provide the logarithmic mean temperature difference required to calculate the heat exchanger area which is necessary for the equipment cost calculation. It is very easy to replace a heater by a HeatX model in Aspen Plus. The only additional information you need is the utility. There is already a list of hot or cold utilities such as steam or cooling water in Aspen Plus, where you just pick the applicable one as shown below:
